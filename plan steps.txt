User 1:                     User2:                  user3                   User4

userId                      userId                  userId                  userId
Level: 1                    Level: 1                Level: 1                Level: 1
clusterSize 1, becomes 4    clusterSize: 1(...2)    clusterSize: 1          clusterSize: 1
leftUser : blank, user2Id   leftUser: blank         leftUser: blank
rightUser : blank  user3Id  rightUser: blank        rightUser: blank



Step 1: User 1 enters with all data,
2nd User Enters
step 2: user 2 enters with userId and level: 1 and clusterSize: 1,
step 3: find parent* User and increment its clustersize by 1 and also enter user2's id in its left hand
3rd User Enters
step 4: find parent* User and increment its clustersize by 1 and also enter user2's id in its right hand
4th User Enters
step 5: find parent* User and increment its clustersize by 1 and also enter user2's id in its left hand
step 6: find grandparent and increment its clusterSize by 1.
step 7: if grandparent's clusterSize becomes 7, its level becomes 2 and clusterSize again goes to 1.

*sort by id or timestamp and enter userId on left of 1st user
